##  Exercises to practice with the Go Programming Language

Im mainly using the book "The Go Programming Language" by Alan A. A. Donovan & Brian W. Kernighan to learn Go. This repository contains exercises from the book and some other exercises that I have found on the internet.

## 1.1
Modify the echo program to also print os.Args[0], the name of the command that invoked it.

## 1.2
Modify the echo program to print the index and value of each of its arguments, one per line.

## 1.3
Experiment to measure the difference in running time between our potentially inefficient versions and the one that uses strings.Join. (Section 1.6 illustrates part of the time package, and Section 11.4 shows how to write benchmark tests for systematic performance evaluation.)

## 1.4
Modify dup2 to print the names of all files in which each duplicated line occurs.
